# JavaChess
Chess game created through the java GUI system

Personally, I created a project and ran this code through the eclipse IDE and it works fine at the moment.
You can download eclipse through this site: https://www.eclipse.org/ide/
Then, you should clone this repository into eclipse and also select a directory location.

Alternatively, you could also use visual studio code as an IDE by cloning the repository and copy and pasting the link there, you may have to install a couple configurations so follow the ide's instructions on what to install from there.

Once you get the files up in your ide, simply run the program with no command line arguments and a new popup window should appear with the java symbol, that is the main chess board.

The output console will also show what a standardized chessboard should look like in key characters and also be calculating legal moves.

On the top of the window, there is a menu bar which has different functions.

The file menu should display Load PNG, which should put in a saved board (This is still being made).
It should also display exit, which simply closes the game and window.

In preferences, it shows flip board, which just flips the game board
Flip board after each move, which flips the board after each move, making it easier for two humans to play on the same computer.
And highlight legal moves, which would let the user know through green dots where a selected piece can move and also red borders around enemy pieces, which shows what pieces the selected piece can attack.

Finally, in the options menu, there are two choices:
1. New game: this simply creates a new game to be played and resets the board back to the standardized board.
2. Undo last move: this would just make the board go back to what it looked like one move before, in case a player did a mistake and would like to undo his mistake.
